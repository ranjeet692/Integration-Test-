This project is a response to the lack of non-plugin based web animations for common 
computer programming algorithm. The animations are written in Processing and 
delivered with Processing.js 
(see http://processingjs.org)

File Organization:

In order to load the sketches within the Processing IDE, all the files related to a specific
animation must be placed in the same folder.  Multiple sketches cannot exist in the same
directory.  This limitation is a Processing IDE issue but not a Processing.js one. Many of the
algorithms will share common animation objects.  Thus, in order to look at sketches inside the
processing IDE, these shared objects will need to be duplicated.  To avoid duplication, this
source repository will place all pde files inside a single pde directory with a make file that
will correctly duplicate the pde source into correct folders to be viewed inside the processing
IDE.
