run algorithm to produce animation command time line.
commands are:
	- pause
	- array: swap index1 index2
	- array: move dest src
	- array: move indicator which indicator, toIndex
	- splitter: move split
	- code: change highlight
	- code: change code piece (for bigger pieces)
	- tree: move value from fromNode to Node
	- tree: single left rotation parent
	- tree: single right rotation parent
	- tree: double left rotation parent
	- tree: double right rotation parent
	- linked list: removelink fromNode, toNode
	- linked list: addlink fromNode, toNode
	- linked list: reorganize (rearrange nodes so that links are ordered)
	- linked list: add node
	- linked list: delete node
	- swap between two animation objects
